# Nothing to Eat app

The “Nothing to Eat” app, seeks to solve the “there’s nothing to eat in this house” sentiment. The goal was to auto-generate recipes to inspire users to use what’s 
in stock to prepare a meal. The “Nothing to Eat” app, works by adding items to the stock list to represent what the user has on hand. By navigating to the 
“Generate Recipe” button, the user enters some information to inform the app what they would like in general and the app will generate a random recipe. 
The App can also store recipes that it generates or the user enters. Not all recipes make perfect sense, please use your best judgment.
